!! Datatypes and routines for face descriptions.
!!
!! Faces complement elements in the mesh.
!! Each element is enclosed by two faces in each direction. (For cubical
!! elements we get 6 faces enclosing the element).
!! We organize the faces by looking at each direction individually.
!! Thus, each face can be identified by its normal direction and an ID.
!! With this approach it is possible to use the same identification numbers
!! as for the elements and also to utilize the level descriptor that is
!! available for the elements, by just using it for each direction separately.
!!
!! For each face we have two sides (left in negative axis direction and right
!! in positive axis direction): left < | > right.
!! Accordingly we have two adjacent elements.
!! See [[tem_face_module]] for some more details about the internals and
!! the construction of the face information.
!!
!! Faces can have properties attached to them, similar to the properties
!! we have for elements.
!! It is possible to combine the properties by adding the corresponding
!! properties, i.e.
!! [[tem_faceData_module:tem_fromFinerFace_prp]]
!! + [[tem_faceData_module:tem_remoteFace_prp]]
!! represents a face which is communicated, but at the same time a face from
!! a finer level (i.e. in this situation is is a halo which is refined on
!! the remote partition).

  !> Mapping from spatial direction to left and right face.
  !!
  !! Each cubic element has 6 faces. In many solvers the different
  !! spatial directions are treated similarly, but just rotated. Therefore,
  !! in this module, we have left and right faces of an element.
  !! The following array provides a mapping from spatial direction
  !! to left or right face.
  !! In 2D the situation is as follows:
  !!```
  !!                                      right face in y
  !!                           ------------------------------
  !!                          /             / q__N         /
  !!       y dir             /             /              /
  !!        /               /  q__W       /      q__E    /
  !!       /     left face / <---------elem---------->  /   right face in x
  !!      /               /             /              /
  !!     /               /             /              /
  !!    /               /             / q__S         /
  !!   /               ------------------------------
  !!                            left face in y
  !!  ------------> x dir
  !!```
  !! In a similar way, we can generalize the upper situation to 3D. To convert
  !! direction a face direction, e.g.
  !! [[tem_param_module:q__e]] q__E, to a face direction access the
  !! following array by tem_dirToFace_map(q__E).
  integer, dimension(6), parameter :: tem_dirToFace_map =       &
    & [ tem_left, tem_left, tem_left,   &
    &   tem_right, tem_right, tem_right ]

  integer, parameter :: tem_fluidFace_prp = 2

  !> Left/right property of a face if the left/right element of the face is a
  !! from finer element.
  integer, parameter :: tem_fromFinerFace_prp = 4

  !> Left/right property of a face if the left/right element of the face is a
